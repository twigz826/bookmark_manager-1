In steps;
  - The user visits the webpage in the client.
  - The client sends a GET request for the webpage to the controller.
  - The controller requests some of the page's content (`.all` instances of the `Bookmark` class) from the model.
  - The model supplies that content (in the form of an array of `.all` `[bookmarks]`) to the controller.
  - The controller sends the content to the `.erb` view, which formats the content in HTML and CSS.
  - The view supplies the controller, which in turn supplies the client.
  - The client renders the webpage to the user.
